# Overview

The MSYT process is complicated.  In involves a number of processes

- data extraction for BCGW sources
- updates to VRI for fire fixes
- initial stand classification
- assessment of silviculture treatment dates (by opening)
- initial assessment of RESULTS forest cover information
  - incomplete records
  - multi layered stands
  - reserves
- assessment of VRI for non harvested components within an opening
- initial assessment of RESULTS planting information
- integration of planting and forest cover information
  - ingress
  - mortality
- stands harvested prior to 1987
  - VRI species and density
  - backgrown from the VRI reference date
- generation of planted and natural BEC aggregates
- BEC crosswalks (substitutions)
- tsa average planting numbers
- generating yield inputs
  - current
  - future
